* Aggregate Scalar String Date and Time Functions - drop table, create table, insert into (table) values, sum, max, avg, currentdate
* Joins - select, from, inner join, on, where, left join, left outer join, join as, and
* Joins 2 - select, from, inner join, on, where, left outer join, full outer join, on, in

Working with database from python
* Connecting to Db2 with Python
* Access DB2 on Cloud using Python - ibm_db, connect, exec_immediate, fetch_row, fetch_both, ibm_db_dbi, read_sql
* Accessing Databases with SQL Magic - %%sql, create table, insert into (table) values, select, from, where, group by, matplotlib inline, seaborn.barplot
* Analyzing a real world data-set with SQL and Python - select, count, max, from, where, seaborn.swarmplot
* Real Data Practice - select, where, count, syscat.columns, colname, typename, length, max, desc, limit, order by, replace, decimal, <, group by, sum, order by, and
